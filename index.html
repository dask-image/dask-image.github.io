  <a href="#intro"><h2>Intro</h2></a>

  This organization includes a collection of libraries that perform basic image
  processing routines on
  <a href="http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/array.html">Dask arrays</a>. Using
  Dask arrays makes it easier define computations that work out-of-core. Also
  it makes it easier to parallelize Python code without having to leave
  Python.

  <a href="#purpose"><h2>Purpose</h2></a>

  The main objective of this organization is to provide a reasonable subset of
  functions from SciPy's
  <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html">ndimage</a>
  package implemented so as to work with Dask arrays. The implementations here
  do this by either wrapping the existing SciPy ndimage functions or by
  reimplementing them with equivalent operations on Dask arrays. In either
  case, their results are tested against equivalent functions from SciPy
  ndimage to ensure they are being faithfully reproduced.

  <br>
  <br>

  <a href="#caveats"><h2>Caveats</h2></a>

  While the initial goal is to provide Dask array implementations of all of
  these functions, libraries may be released before having implemented all
  functions, or all options to all functions, or without applying some
  constraints to the functions. This is done because this is seen as an
  incremental work that is driven by research needs. That said, the goal is to
  have feature complete implementations of these functions in the end.

  Below is a list of the libraries that implement the different sets of
  functions from SciPy ndimage with Dask arrays. Links to their repos are
  provided so that more info about them can be found.
